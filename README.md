# Arduino Controller

Arduino Controller is created for demo of how to connect Arduino using HC-05 (Bluetooth Module) with Android Phone.

## Requirements

1. Android Studio [Windows](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) [Mac](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) [Linux](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads)

## Usage

#### If you want to use the app as it is, you can download it from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jagtap.raj.arduinocontrol)

#### If you want to use the code and make something new out of it feel free to go through it.

### Steps
1. Install Android Studio if you don't have the SDK.
2. Clone this repository:
- Direct [download](https://github.com/jagtapraj123/ArduinoControl/archive/master.zip)
- Using the command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jagtapraj123/ArduinoControl.git
```

3. Open the app in Android Studio.
4. Go through the code and find how to connect a Bluetooth Module using SPP   
(Serial Port Protocol).
5. Feel free to change the layout and values to send as per you.

## Purpose

This repository was created for teaching how to make an Android App to connect with Arduino using HC-05 and make a remote control.

It was created as a part of the workshop on making remote-controlled car using Arduino organized by The Electronics and Club, [IIT Goa](https://www.iitgoa.ac.in/)
